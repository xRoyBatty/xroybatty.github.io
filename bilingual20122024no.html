INTRODUCTION TO A BOOK ON LINGUISTICS
Language has been an object of fascination and a subject of serious enquiry for over
2,000 years. Often, the observations have been subjective and anecdotal, as people reflected
7.1. ____ such topics as the nature of meaning, ideals of correctness, and the origins
of language. But from the earliest periods there has also been an objective approach, with
scholars 7.2. ____ aspects of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation in a detailed
and organized way. At the end of the 18th century, the subject attracted an increasing number
of specialists, so much so that it rapidly became possible to see the emergence of a new field
of scientific research with language analysis as its focus. Originally, this approach, first
known as philology, 7.3. ____ exclusively with the historical development of language. In the
last century, the subject broadened to include the whole range of subject 7.4. ____
represented in this book, and it is now generally called linguistics or linguistic science.
Linguistics today is a widely practised academic discipline, with several domains
of application.
The earliest linguistic debate is found in the pages of Plato. Cratylus is a dialogue about
the origins of language and the nature of meaning. The debate is continued at 7.5. ______,
but no firm conclusion is reached.

WILL WE EVER TALK TO ANIMALS?
History is littered with animals who have “communicated” with humans, but, as work with
dolphins shows, it is difficult to strike 8.1. _______________ a two-way conversation. Wild
dolphin communication is hard to study. They communicate at frequencies beyond what
humans can hear. They are fast-moving and hard to follow. 8.2. _______________ these
challenges, there is some evidence that dolphins use sounds to represent concepts. Each
individual has its own “signature whistle” which might act like a name. Dolphins use these
whistles as badges of identity, and may modulate 8.3. _______________ to reflect motivation
and mood.
They also have a “natural propensity” for creating shared information when they have to
interact. For example, in Costa Rica, distantly related bottlenose and Guyana dolphins will
adopt a joint collection of sounds whenever they get together, using sounds that they don’t use
when apart. But 8.4. _______________ humans to communicate with dolphins, more research

GLASS BEACH – THE DUMP YOU’LL WANT TO VISIT
Mother Nature is sometimes able to right the things that we, humans, mess up. Glass Beach
in Fort Bragg, California, gained its unique name because of the tons of smooth colourful glass

residents who discarded their household garbage, glass, appliances and even cars there.
Nobody looked after the area. Sometimes fires were lit in an 7.1. _____ to reduce the size of

started. 7.4. _____, it proved impossible to remove the glass which had mingled among
the pebbles. Over the next few decades the pounding waves cleansed the beach, weathering
down the glass into the small, smooth, coloured trinkets that are found there today. In 2002,
the California State Park system took over the Glass Beach property, and it was 7.5. _____
into the MacKerricher State Park. Although many people go to the beach to forage for glass,
this is actively discouraged and signs warn that removal of glass is not allowed.

THE DAY WINSTON CHURCHILL LOST HIS CIGAR

in the Speaker’s Chamber where, the evening before, I had set up my lights and camera.
The Prime Minister, arm-in-arm with Churchill and followed by his entourage, entered
the room. I switched on my floodlights; a surprised Churchill growled, “What’s this, what’s
this?” No one had the courage to explain. I cautiously stepped forward and said, “Sir, I hope
I will be fortunate enough to make a portrait worthy of this historic occasion.” He glanced at

in 2012, they were also producing renewable energy? And as a result, they 7.1. _____ to
a breakthrough in renewable power.
Around one million or so visitors alighted at West Ham underground station to get to the
Games. Access to the Olympic Park was via a tiled walkway. Using a hybrid technology that

original source: footsteps. Laurence Kemball-Cook, 7.3. _____ behind the technology,
dreamt up the idea of turning footsteps into power when he worked at Loughborough

The young inventor calls his creation “footfall harvesting”. How does it work? The tile surface

produce an average of six watts per footstep. During the two weeks of the Games, the tiles
generated 20 kilowatt-hours or 72 million joules, which provided 7.5. _____ energy to keep
the walkway lights illuminated at full power through the night, and at half power during the
day, with plenty of back-up energy to spare. Kemball-Cook sees renewable energy
technology as a potential alternative to solar, which is difficult to use indoors or in built-up
urban areas.

THE FUTURE OF WINTER SPORTS AND RECREATION
Since 1949, nearly 80% of weather stations across the contiguous 48 states in the US have

THE SECRETS OF THE TOWER OF LONDON’S ROYAL RAVENMASTER
There are some weird jobs associated with the British royal household. For example, there’s
a keeper of the monarch’s stamps and a royal clock winder. And then there’s the
ravenmaster: Christopher Skaife, 7.1. _____ with caring for the seven corvids that reside at
the Tower of London. Every mention of the Tower’s ravens makes reference to how King
Charles II issued a royal decree to protect the ravens for evermore, after having been
warned that if the birds ever 7.2. _____ away, the Tower itself would crumble to dust and
great harm would befall the kingdom. Great story, but total codswallop, says Skaife, who has
pored through the archives and found out that the first mention of ravens at the Tower
appeared not in the 17th century, when Charles reigned through the years of plague and fire,
but during the Victorian age, when the gothic revival was in full swing.
Up close, the ravens resemble enormous crows dipped in oil. What do they do all day? They
perch on benches, play with magpies and rummage through the rubbish bins. Skaife says
the ravens, like most Brits, have a weakness for potato crisps, which they scavenge and then
wash in puddles if the flavouring – say, cheddar and onion – is not to their 7.3. _____.
“Ravens are surprisingly similar to us. They mate for life, more or less, and are capable of
great cruelty and great kindness,” he explains.
The ravens in the Tower can fly, but not very well and not too far. They flap up to the rooftops
and battlements. Previous caregivers substantially trimmed ravens’ feathers 7.4. _____ them
from flying altogether, but Skaife vowed to trim as little as possible. He calls it “feather
management”, just a snip, more in the long, warm days of summer and less in the cold, dark
winter.
Skaife himself is an unending source of raven lore – not just myths and stories, but habits
and personalities. “I never get bored of watching how ravens go about their lives,” he says.
“You just never know what they’re going to do, so you’ve always got to be on your 7.5. _____
when you’re looking after them.”

THE DAY WINSTON CHURCHILL LOST HIS CIGAR

becomes emblematic of a specific day in history. Such is the 7.1. _____ with the iconic photo
of Winston Churchill taken by Yousuf Karsh. This is what Karsh wrote about Churchill’s

My portrait of Winston Churchill changed my life. After I had taken it, I knew that it was
an important picture, but I 7.2. _____ that it would become one of the most widely
reproduced images in the history of photography. In 1941, Churchill visited first Washington
and then Ottawa. The Prime Minister of Canada, Mackenzie King, invited me to be present
and take some photos of the visit. After Churchill’s electrifying speech, I waited
in the Speaker’s Chamber where, the evening before, I had set up my lights and camera.
The Prime Minister, arm-in-arm with Churchill and followed by his entourage, entered
the room. I switched on my floodlights; a surprised Churchill growled, “What’s this, what’s
this?” No one had the courage to explain. I cautiously stepped forward and said, “Sir, I hope
I will be fortunate enough to make a portrait worthy of this historic occasion.” He glanced at
me and lit a fresh cigar, puffed at it with a mischievous air, and then generously 7.3. _____
and said, “You may take one.” I held out an ashtray, but he would not dispose of his cigar.
I waited; he continued to chomp vigorously at his cigar. I waited. Then I stepped toward him
and, without premeditation, but 7.4. _____ respectfully, I said, “Forgive me, sir,” and plucked
the cigar out of his mouth. By the time I got back to my camera, he looked so belligerent he
could have devoured me. It was at that instant that I took the photograph. Churchill then
smiled and said, “You may take another one,” and shook my hand, telling me, “You can even
make a roaring lion stand still to be photographed.”
This second photo, in which Churchill is smiling, never 7.5. _____ in history as the other did.
The first one was published in PM, an American daily newspaper, and even graced the cover

ENGLISH BUTLERS ARE IN DEMAND
As the travelling butler to a self-made Asian multimillionaire, an industrialist who sleeps less
than four hours a night and hurtles around the globe networking and building his empire, I am
perhaps in a good position to explain why demand for English butlers is on the increase.
The modern butler bears little resemblance to Mr Carson, the impeccably mannered
character from the popular TV series Downton Abbey. In that era, the butler had to embody
the virtues demanded of the head of a household, ensuring that the rest of the staff were
performing their duties and following the protocols of their rank. In this regard, I am
hard-pressed to find any parallels between Mr Carson’s role and my own.
In my experience, the two most desirable qualities in a good butler are loyalty and discretion.
It’s no surprise to me that it is English butlers who are most in demand. For the new
super-rich, an English butler is a status symbol akin to having a Swiss banker to manage
their finances. The English are seen as cultured, dignified, reserved when needed, and able
to adapt to any given situation, without giving way to emotion or anxiety. They are also there
to bring a certain sophistication and old-world charm to the halls of their employers’
pretentious homes; they add a touch of class alongside the gold taps and kitschy
chandeliers.
Constantly by my master’s side, I am privy to things that even his inner circle do not know.
As the relationship grows, I observe his quirks and vices, some of which are not always
palatable. But with knowledge comes power, and with power comes responsibility. Once I
have earned his trust, the lines between master and servant begin to blur. I do not expect to
be treated as an equal; nor would I want to be. But the hope is that one day he will come to
rely on having me by his side so completely that my absence would be unthinkable. There is
an unspoken understanding that one day the balance of power will shift, and the butler will
know more about what his master wants than the master himself.
As a modern-day butler, I’m expected to be well versed in etiquette, and conduct myself with
a suitable demeanour; I must also adapt to my master’s culture and all the inconveniences
this brings with it. The present-day butler must be able to navigate the tribulations of the
world with efficiency and style and, in whichever way he can, make life a little bit easier for
his employer. And, in this respect, the job of a butler probably has not changed much since
the 19th century, other than the fact that I carry two mobile phones instead of my master’s
coat-tails.

WHEN WILL MY COMPUTER UNDERSTAND ME?
It’s not hard for humans to distinguish the “charge” of a battery from criminal “charges”, but for
computers, 7.1. _____ between the various meanings of a word is problematic. Even though
linguists and computer scientists have been trying hard to get computers to understand human
language by programming semantics as software, they have had mixed success. It was driven
initially by attempts to translate Russian technical texts during the Cold War, and more recently
by data analysis tools. A few of IBM’s systems and Google Translate are high-profile,
successful applications of language technologies, but even they were at first liable to produce
humorous answers and mistranslations, which was evidence of the difficulty of the problem.

crystal clear to dictionary-makers can be murky to the dictionary reader. Moreover, no two

the words to create a weighted map of relationships? Different meanings of the same word

the meaning in a particular context. In other words, researchers hope to get to a point where
a computer will be able to interpret the speaker’s intention. Until that goal 7.5. _____,
computers won’t understand languages as well as a human being does.

BUGS BUNNY
More than eighty years ago, in 1940, a grey rabbit hopped out of a hole in the ground. Then
he knocked on a bald man’s head and asked, “What’s Up, Doc?” to the sound of the
crunching of a large carrot. 8.1. ____________________ the rabbit had appeared previously
in short cartoons, it was this memorable scene that paved the way for the version of the
rabbit that would become the cultural icon named Bugs Bunny. In the decades since then,
Bugs has appeared in over 150 films, earned a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and
even got his face on a postage stamp. What is the reason for such immense popularity?
Some might say that, 8.2. ____________________ Disney’s Mickey Mouse and Donald
Duck, who come with their own set of physical characteristics but lack much personality,
Bugs is sharply defined by his know-it-all attitude and witty banter. Others claim that what
sets Bugs Bunny 8.3. ____________________ from many cartoon characters is his ability to
stay true to himself. The fact is that from his opera debut in “What’s Opera, Doc?” to his
appearances in action films, Bugs Bunny hasn’t changed at all. More recent animated
characters have established themselves through a sliding scale of meanness but Bugs still
remains the lovable character who only 8.4. ____________________ fun of those who
deserve it most. So this could be the reason why Bugs Bunny still goes down really well with
people all over the world.
