<h3>Accusations of Deception Fly in Polish Politics</h3>
<p>
The leader of Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), Jarosław Kaczyński, has <span style="background-color:yellow;" id="gap1">1. __________</span> the current government coalition of “deception” during a recent rally. Kaczyński <span style="background-color:yellow;" id="gap2">2. __________</span> that the opposition’s campaign promises were “a multi-layered deception” aimed at misleading the Polish people. 

He specifically <span style="background-color:yellow;" id="gap3">3. __________</span> the opposition for making false promises about the economy and the daily lives of Poles. According to Kaczyński, during its eight years in power, PiS <span style="background-color:yellow;" id="gap4">4. __________</span> Poland from a “third-world country” to a “civilized state” by, among other things, addressing the issue of child poverty. He <span style="background-color:yellow;" id="gap5">5. __________</span> that this was achieved despite opposition claims of insufficient funds.

Kaczyński also <span style="background-color:yellow;" id="gap6">6. __________</span> the opposition for failing to deliver on its 100-day plan, stating that only nine out of 100 promises have been <span style="background-color:yellow;" id="gap7">7. __________</span>. He argued that this demonstrates the opposition's <span style="background-color:yellow;" id="gap8">8. __________</span> to deceive the public.

Turning to the issue of national security, Kaczyński questioned whether Poland should be a strong and independent nation or <span style="background-color:yellow;" id="gap9">9. __________</span> on Germany and, increasingly, Russia. He contrasted his party's goal of making Poland a leading force in the European Union with the current government's perceived weakness on security matters.

Kaczyński specifically criticized the former Prime Minister Donald Tusk for his <span style="background-color:yellow;" id="gap10">10. __________</span> on Russia’s actions on the Polish border, claiming that Tusk has shifted his position from downplaying the threat to now acknowledging it as “hybrid warfare.” Kaczyński concluded by asserting that Tusk is not a reliable guarantor of national security.
