                <p class="post-intro">Starting June 7, 2026, new regulations on pay transparency will take effect across the European Union, marking a significant step toward gender pay equality. Companies with over 50 employees will be required to disclose salary data, while those with more than 100 workers must report on gender-based pay gaps.</p>

                <h2>Key Changes in Pay Transparency</h2>
                <p>The European Union has introduced new regulations to strengthen the principle of equal pay for equal work between women and men. These regulations aim to increase pay transparency, improve law enforcement, and reduce gender pay gaps, which currently stand at around 13% across the EU to women's disadvantage. The directive, adopted on April 24, 2023, also addresses pension gaps.</p>

                <h2>Definition of Equal Work</h2>
                <p>The directive clarifies that "same work" refers to positions requiring comparable skills and scope of activities, while "work of equal value" encompasses roles with different duties but requiring similar competencies, commitment, and responsibility. Employees in such positions should receive comparable compensation, regardless of gender.</p>

                <h2>Company Requirements</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Companies must create transparent compensation systems</li>
                    <li>Employees gain the right to information about pay levels for equivalent positions</li>
                    <li>Employers cannot restrict access to this data or hide pay-setting criteria</li>
                    <li>Job listings must include salary information</li>
                    <li>Questions about previous salaries during recruitment are prohibited</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Current State of Pay Gap in Poland</h2>
                <p>According to recent data from March 2024, significant gender pay disparities persist:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Average gross monthly salary: 8,604.72 PLN</li>
                    <li>Men's median salary: 6,770.08 PLN (3.4% above general median)</li>
                    <li>Women's median salary: 6,357.44 PLN (2.9% below general median)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Industry-Specific Differences</h2>
                <p>The Information and Communication sector leads with average earnings of nearly 15,000 PLN. The largest gender pay disparities appear in the Financial and Insurance sector, exceeding 7,000 PLN to women's disadvantage. Interestingly, in construction, women earned on average 1,300 PLN more than men.</p>

                <h2>Long-term Impact</h2>
                <p>The gender pay gap affects not only women's current living standards but also their pensions, increasing the risk of poverty in old age. According to ZUS data, the average pension in 2024 is approximately 3,500 PLN gross, with men receiving around 4,700 PLN and women 3,200 PLN.</p>

                <h2>Implementation Timeline</h2>
                <p>The reporting schedule depends on company size, with the largest employers required to begin compliance by mid-2027. Companies showing gender pay gaps exceeding 5% without neutral justification must conduct detailed salary analyses and implement corrective measures.</p>
