# Roy's Blog

This is the repository for my personal blog hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Structure

- `index.html` - Main page with latest posts
- `tech.html` - Technology category page
- `culture.html` - Culture category page
- `css/` - Stylesheet directory
- `posts/` - Individual blog post files
- `templates/` - Templates for new posts

## Adding New Posts

1. Use the template from `/templates/post.html`
2. Create a new file in `/posts/` with the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.html`
3. Replace all placeholder values marked with {{PLACEHOLDER}}
4. Add the post content
5. Update the main page to include the new post

## Local Development

Since this is a static site, you can test it locally by:
1. Cloning the repository
2. Opening the HTML files in a browser
3. Or using a local server (e.g., `python -m http.server`)
